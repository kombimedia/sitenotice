October CMS plugin to add site notice (Bootstrap modal) to a page

Pretty simple really. Clone plugin repo to the plugins dir of your project. Run `php artisan october:up` if required.
You'll see a new menu item in your dashboard navbar "Site Notices". Here you can create site notices. Add the component to a page that you would like the notice to appear and select the required notice.
Each notice can be configured individually:
- enabled/disabled
- delay to open
- modal width
- modal heading, content, button label and button link

Enjoy
